Assignment 1: JavaScript - Task Automation with HTML and CSS Integration
Objective: This assignment evaluates the candidate's proficiency in JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and their ability
to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
Task:
1. Node.js Script:
• Write a Node.js script that accomplishes the following:
• Creates a new directory named "task_automation" if it doesn't exist.
• Inside the directory, creates three text files: "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" with any
content.
• Concatenates the content of the three files into a new file named "concatenated.txt" inside
the same directory.
• Prints the content of "concatenated.txt" to the console.
• Deletes "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt" from the directory.

2. HTML and CSS:
• Create an HTML file named "index.html" with a simple form that allows users to input text into three
separate fields.
• Style the form using a CSS file named "styles.css" to make it visually appealing.
3. DOM Manipulation:
• Using JavaScript in a separate file named "script.js":
• Link the "script.js" file to the HTML file.
• Implement functionality that, on submitting the form, appends the entered text from each
field to a new paragraph in a "results" div on the page.
• Style the appended paragraphs dynamically (e.g., different colors for each paragraph).

Assignment 2: Javascript - Data Manipulation
Objective: This assignment is designed to evaluate the candidate's ability to work with data manipulation in Javascript.
Task:
Write a Javascript script that performs the following tasks:
1. Data Preparation:
• Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a person with attributes "name," "age,"
and "city." Include at least three persons in the list.

2. Filtering:
• Filter out persons who are under the age of 25.
3. Sorting:
• Sort the remaining persons based on their city in alphabetical order.
4. Output:
• Print the final list of persons to the console, including their name, age, and city.

Evaluation Criteria:
• Correctness and completion of each task.
• Code organization and clarity.
• Proper use of HTML and CSS for form creation and styling.
• Effective DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
• Creativity in styling the form and dynamically appending content.
• Comments and documentation.
Submission:
• Submit three files: one JavaScript file, one HTML file, and one CSS file.
• Submit the single Javascript file containing the script.
• Include comments in each file to explain the purpose of different sections of the code.
